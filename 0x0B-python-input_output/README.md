project in Python typically involves learning how to work with files and manage input/output operations. Here's a brief overview of key concepts:
Key Concepts:

    Reading Files:
        Use open() to open files in read mode ('r').
        Read the content using methods like read(), readline(), or readlines().

    Writing Files:
        Open files in write ('w') or append ('a') mode.
        Write content using write() or writelines().

    Working with File Descriptors:
        Use with open(...) as file: for file operations to ensure files are properly closed.
        Avoid manual file closing (file.close()).

    JSON Serialization/Deserialization:
        Use json module for converting Python objects to JSON (dump()/dumps()) and vice versa (load()/loads()).

    File Permissions and Modes:
        Understand different file access modes ('r', 'w', 'a', 'b', '+').
        Work with file permissions using os and stat modules.

    Error Handling:
        Handle exceptions like FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, etc., using try...except.

    Custom Input/Output Functions:
        Implement and use functions to handle input/output operations programmatically.

    Use of os and shutil Modules:
        Perform file system operations such as copying, renaming, and deleting files/directories.
